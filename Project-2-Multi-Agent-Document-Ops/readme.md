🚀 Project 2: Compliance & Rewrite Team
Goal: Two agents work at the same time. One checks for safety, the other polishes the text. A manager merges their work.

Core Concept: Fan-Out / Fan-In. This pattern is standard for "Map-Reduce" style operations or when you have independent tasks (like checking legal compliance while simultaneously generating marketing copy).
